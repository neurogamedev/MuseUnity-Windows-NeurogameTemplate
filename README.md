#   Demo Template for Windows platforms using the Muse headset. Built in Unity. 

This Neurogame Template Demo is made in Unity 6 Preview, built upon Interaxon's Muse SDK. Check examples of how your Neurosity device can easily be used in-game.  
Turn your Bluetooth on and hit play. **You don't need to connect your Muse 2 to your PC's Bluetooth devices beforehand.**  

It is recommended to use a headband with a full battery, adjust it well and avoid any headgear that could phisically interfere with its placement.  
Headphones, for instance, can skew the placement and interfere with the electrodes' coontact with your skin.

## How can I learn to make neurogames?

You need to know how to make games first.  
Then, I recommend checking The Wiki for more information on the "neuro" part of neurogames.
